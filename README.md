ProjectPulse is a web-based project management and visibility platform I built to help small IT teams and contractors track projects in real time.

## Features
- Admin and Client portals
- UPS shipment tracking integration
- Photo management for project folders
- Assign projects and track progress

## Demo Script
The `ProjectPulseDemo.js` script is a simple demonstration of how project updates can be dynamically displayed on a webpage.

## Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Frontend demo only (can be extended with backend)
- Designed to showcase UI and project logic

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. The script will populate the project list dynamically.
3. Modify `ProjectPulseDemo.js` to add new projects or statuses.
